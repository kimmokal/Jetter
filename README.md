# Jetter - a Jet tuple producer from CMS MiniAOD

This is a CMSSW module for producing mostly flat tuples from 13 TeV Run2 MC samples.

The code works on lxplus and CMSSW_8_0_26, and requires grid permissions to access data:
```voms-proxy-init --voms cms```


## Setting up

First setup your GitHub:
```
git config --global user.name 'Your Name'
git config --global user.email 'your@ema.il'
git config --global user.github 'username'
```
Make sure you register your SSH key: https://help.github.com/articles/generating-ssh-keys


Creating the work area
```
ssh -Y CERNusername@lxplus.cern.ch

mkdir WorkingArea
cd WorkingArea
cmsrel CMSSW_8_0_26
cd CMSSW_8_0_26/src
cmsenv
git clone https://github.com/kimmokal/Jetter/
scram b
cd Jetter/MiniAnalyzer
```

## Running the code

If desired, change the input file and the output name in ```python/ConfFile_cfg.py```.

To generate the tuples, execute
```
cmsRun python/ConfFile_cfg.py
```

## Content of the tuples

Variables are saved to ROOT trees jet by jet.

In this version, the reconstructed jets are AK4 jets clustered from Particle Flow candidates. The standard L1+L2+L3+residual energy corrections are applied to the jets and pileup is reduced using the CHS algorithm.
