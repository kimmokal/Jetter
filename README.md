# Jetter - a Jet nanotuple producer from CMS MiniAOD

This project is a CMSSW module producing mostly flat tuples from run 2 data/MC.

So far the code works on lxplus and CMSSW_8_0_26, and requires grid permissions to access data:
```voms-proxy-init -voms cms```


## Setting up

First setup your GitHub:
```
git config --global user.name 'Your Name'
git config --global user.email 'your@ema.il'
git config --global user.github 'username'
```
Make sure you register your SSH key: https://help.github.com/articles/generating-ssh-keys


Creating the work area
```
ssh -Y CERNusername@lxplus.cern.ch

mkdir WorkingArea
cd WorkingArea
cmsrel CMSSW_8_0_26
cd CMSSW_8_0_26/src
cmsenv
git clone https://github.com/kimmokal/Jetter/
scram b
cd Jetter/MiniAnalyzer
```

## Running the code

Change the input file in python/ConfFile_cfg.py and if desired, the output filename in plugins/MiniAnalyzer.cc .

To generate the tuples, run
```
    cmsRun python/ConfFile_cfg.py
```
And to view the tuples in ROOT
```
    root -l nanotuple_*
    TBrowser a
```
from there use the graphical interface.


## Content of the tuples

Data variables are saved to ROOT trees jet by jet.

In this version, the reconstructed jets are AK4 jets clustered from Particle Flow candidates. The standard L1+L2+L3+residual energy corrections are applied to the jets and pileup is reduced using the CHS algorithm.

Some of the variables (such as jetRawPhi) are admittedly redundant.

There are also variables for 'jet images' (arXiv:1612.01551 [hep-ph]), for which every Particle Flow (PF) candidate within the area Δη<1 && Δϕ<1 around the jet center is saved. This includes particles which are not part of the jet.
